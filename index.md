## [C++ Plugin for Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook](https://gist.github.com/akshaykhadse/7acc91dd41f52944c6150754e5530c4b)

As it turns out, Google Colab does not support full fleged Javascript customization. Hence, the syntax highlighting from extensions like [ipybind](https://github.com/aldanor/ipybind) does not work over to Google Colab.

My [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62901092/cpp-syntax-highlighting-for-google-colab) went unanswered. Hence, I wrote a simple extension to add magics for syntax highlighting and compiling the code. No fancy interpretted C++ stuff here!
